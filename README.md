# Big data navigation maps that are safe for shipping (collaboration with Danish Geodata Agency)

The [Danish Geodata Agency](http://www.gst.dk/English/) produce data and maps that are used in naval navigation in danish territorial waters including Greenland. Having highly accurate digital map data for a coastline as vast as the one surrounding Greenland, is a challenge. To make it possible to work with the data, so-called simplification algorithms are used, which transforms a high resolution geometric object (such as a coastline) into a low-resolution geometric object.

When producing maps for navigation, it is important that geographic features such as a small island are not "simplified away". Although small in area, such a small rocky island may still cause a ship wreck! Another example could be a small peninsula that although small protrudes out into the ocean crossing an important shipping line.

That map data is often simplified can be seen on the following two images from Google Maps. They are of the same area on the [coast of Greenland](https://maps.google.com/?ll=64.078279,-51.448288&spn=0.020974,0.076904&t=m&z=14).

As can be seen, it would be unwise to navigate a ship according to the map images of Greenland from Google Maps.
